# Migrating to IBM Cloud
{: #migrate}

On December 18, 2017, IBM launched {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, which marks the beginning of the process to migrate all {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} instances from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/knowledge-studio-migration/?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=Marketplace){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses the term _workspace_, while {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace uses the term _project_. The functionality is the same. Only the terminology is different.
{: tip}

If you need to comply with GDPR, you must migrate to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform. {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace has been retired and is not suitable for clients who require compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679.

- Determine the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource group you want to migrate your service to. See [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group
](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups) for tips. You will need to communicate the name and ID of the resource group to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to begin the migration process.
- Decide which {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region to host your service instance in. View available regions on the [{{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/knowledge-studio).
