## Lesson 1: Assigning user roles
{: #wks_tutless1}

In this lesson, you will learn about the different roles that you can assign to users in {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}}.

### About this task
{: #wks_tutless1_about}

The creation of a machine learning model requires input from subject matter experts, project managers, and users who can understand and interpret statistical models. Administrators assign roles to each user, such that they have appropriate authority for their tasks. For more information about user roles, see [Assembling a team](/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-team).

### Procedure
{: #wks_tutless1_procedure}

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} with your administrator ID. If you have an existing {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} instance, you can find it on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [resources page](https://{DomainName}/resources){: external} under **Services**.
1. Click the **Settings** icon to open the Service Details page. The page lists all the user IDs that are registered as {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} users. Each user ID has one of the following roles (in decreasing order of included permissions):

    - Admin
    - Project Manager
    - Human Annotator

    For information about user roles, see [User roles in {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}}](/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-roles).

1. Verify that there is at least one user with the Admin role. A user ID with this role can create workspaces, and act as a project manager or human annotator.
1. If you have access to additional user IDs, verify that there are at least two users with the Human Annotator role.

    Creating a real-life model typically involves multiple human annotators in addition to an administrator or project manager. However, for purposes of the tutorial, you can continue with a single user ID.
    {: tip}

1. Optional: Change the role that is assigned to a user ID. From the **Action** column of the table, click the **Edit** link, an then change the assigned user role.

    You can upgrade a user ID to a role with greater permissions, but you cannot downgrade a user with an Admin or Project Manager role to the Human Annotator role.
    {: note}
